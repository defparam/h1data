# H1Stats Data Store

Welcome to the @h1stats datastore! Here you will find nightly uploads of Hackerone public bounty program statistics.
This data is encoded in CSV format for viewing in spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel. Each file is uploaded
nightly and named as `h1stats-<unix_time_stamp>.csv`. You can use the encoded unix time stamp to determine the date which
the data was captured (Timezone: EST/EDT). Feel free to use this data for your own analytical purposes.

For more information on the @h1stats robot, visit: https://reconfig.io/h1/

The script used to obtain this data from h1 is found here: https://github.com/defparam/h1stats
